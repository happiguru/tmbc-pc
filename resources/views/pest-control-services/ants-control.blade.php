                        To get rid of ants, it is important to identify the ant species before attempting ant control. Some ant species, like Pharaoh ants, can be controlled using baits, while others cannot. To get rid of ants successfully,
                        it is usually necessary to follow them back to their colony and treat the colony directly. TMBC&amp;PC professionals have the experience to correctly identify your ants and kill them.

                        The lifespan of ants depends on the caste. Males live for only a few weeks and die after mating. Workers usually live for several months. Queens can live for decades under the right conditions. Ants are active all
                        year long in tropical climates. In cooler climates, they survive the winter by going into a state of dormancy or inactivity known as diapause.
                    </p>
                    <p>Ants are social insects that live in colonies and have several different types or castes of individuals. Each caste has a different function or job in the colony.</p>
                    <p>Workers forage for food, construct the nest and care for the young and the reproductives.</p>
                    <p>
                        Reproductives include the original queen and the swarmers. The original queenâ€™s job is to lay eggs. Swarmers are winged males and females that fly out to start new colonies and spread to new areas. These swarmers
                        mate during the swarm, and the male dies soon after. The queen then locates a suitable nesting site, sheds her wings and begins to set up a colony.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Ants develop by complete metamorphosis, meaning the eggs hatch into larvae that must be cared for by the workers. The larvae pupate into adult workers or reproductives. After two or three years, the colony matures
                        and begins to produce swarmers every year.

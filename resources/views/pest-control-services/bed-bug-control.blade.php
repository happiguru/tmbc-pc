                    <h2>BED BUG CONTROL</h2>
                    <p>
                        Bed bugs are usually around 5mm in size and are reddish-brown in colour with flat, oval bodies.Although they are usually found on mattresses and within bed frames, they can also be found&nbsp;behind loose wall paper,
                        headboards&nbsp;and within other furnishings such as bedside tables, wardrobes, picture frames and electrical sockets! They feed on our blood at night, attracted to the heat, vibration and carbon dioxide, that we
                        breathe as we are asleep.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Homes can become infested with bed bugs in a number of ways, but more often than not it is by luggage or clothing from recent travels. They can also be brought into a home through second hand furniture and in extreme
                        infestation cases&nbsp;they can come from adjoining properties. When a tenant vacates or moves away from their infestation the next blood meal is only a 9â€³ brick wall away.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Bed bugs themselves do not carry diseases but they can cause a great deal of discomfort and bacterial irritations to the skin following a bite.Bed bugs typically feed every 5 to 10 days,&nbsp;spending up to ten
                        minutes to take their blood meal. So if you are experiencing bites every night, there is a very good chance that you&nbsp;are living with&nbsp;quite a few of them!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If conditions are favourable (suitable hosts and warm ambient temperature), females can lay up to 12 eggs a day and up to 500 in a lifetime, which can be up to 18 months.&nbsp; Each egg will hatch within 14 days
                        producing tiny bed bugs called nymphs.&nbsp; These nymphs go through five moulting phases over a 2 to 3 month period, rapidly increasing in size during each phase,&nbsp;to reach adult bed bugs.Adult bed bugs can go
                        up to&nbsp;1.5 years without feeding!
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Will your treatment work and kill the bugs?&nbsp;</strong></p>
                    <p>
                        The simple answer is yes, if you put insecticide that has been designed to kill bed bugs in a property it will kill the bugs; it also follows that if advice from a trained technician is followed then the treatment
                        will be successful.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Will a single treatment work?&nbsp;</strong></p>
                    <p>
                        This is very dependent on the initial infestation encountered. If you have a lot of bugs and the infestation has been mismanaged then you may require further treatments. This is not to say the process is not working
                        but a more integrated pest management system would have to be adopted.

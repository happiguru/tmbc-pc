                        Spiders usually enter homes in two primary ways: Through open and poorly screened windows or doors. Through cracks and gaps around door and window frames. Most of the time, spiders come inside the home looking for
                        food and shelter. The other common method of entry is accidentally hitchhiking inside boxes, on outdoor items and numerous other things that are brought inside your home or business premises.<br />

                        Spiders may be harboring outdoors in piles of firewood and debris, under items lying on the ground or in voids in hollow blocks, while others may live in attics and crawl spaces or other areas throughout the home. A
                        thorough, professional inspection from TMBC&amp;PC will reveal these hiding spots and help eliminate spiders from your home

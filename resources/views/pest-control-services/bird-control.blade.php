                    <p>
                        Bird control is the generic name for methods to eliminate or deter pest birds from landing, roosting and nesting. It is important to use professional bird control products that do not harm birds, other animals or
                        people. When in doubt call a professional bird control installer.

                        Bird control is important because pest birds especially Pigeons which are commonly found in this part of the world can create health-related problems through their feces, including diseases like Histoplasmosis,
                        Cryptococcosis Psittacosis etc.

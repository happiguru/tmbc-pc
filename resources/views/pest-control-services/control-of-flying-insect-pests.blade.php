                        The majority of insects have wings in their adult stage and move around mainly by flying. However insects like cockroaches, have wings but are reluctant flyers and mainly use crawling as a form of transportation.
                        Termites and ants are flyers, but only for a brief time in their reproductive stages during their breeding season.
                    </p>

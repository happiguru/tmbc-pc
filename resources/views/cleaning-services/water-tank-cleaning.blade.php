                    <h2>WATER TANK CLEANING</h2>
                    <p>
                        <img class="alignleft" alt="" src="{{ asset('wtos-images/430471_Wt.jpg') }}" />The cleaning and disinfecting of water tanks is highly important for a hygienic life. It is from these water tanks that the water
                        for consumption is supplied. Therefore, the cleaner the water tank, the healthier our life.<br />
                        It is a well known fact that contaminated water is one of the most common causes of illness to mankind. Around 60% of diseases caused to humans are water-borne, with children below 5 years more susceptible. One of
                        the most usual ways of water getting contaminated is via the manner in which a water storage tank is maintained. A large number of people either neglect the thorough cleaning of the water tank or simply opt for
                        services of a local plumber or sweeper. The water stored in tanks for a long period provides an ideal ground for mould and bacteria growth. But, are you aware that, if not cleaned, your water tank could harbour
                        harmful bacteria, decaying vegetation, insects, reptiles or even dead animals, eventually becoming life threats?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It is the responsibility of every individual to ensure that they get their water tank cleaned regularly in order to have a safer and healthier life. Apart from just the ordinary bacteria, an unclean/contaminated
                        water tank can harbour even the potentially dangerous bacteria such as the Legionella. However, neglected tanks, reservoirs and cooling towers are extremely high risk areas for the spread of the disease caused by
                        these bacteria. This particular bacterium can proliferate where conditions in water systems are allowed to deteriorate.

                        Water is the most important element of out life. We use water in our day to day life for drinking, washing, cleaning, etc. Water tank cleaning at regular interval is important for the health of mankind. Water from
                        water tank is used for bathing, brushing, washing and even for cooking. Not cleaning the tanks in regular intervals sometimes leads to compromising on the health of habitants. Around 60% of diseases caused to humans
                        are water-borne. Contamination of water is major cause of illness to mankind and most usual ways water getting contaminated is through improper maintenance or not cleaning water tank at regular interval. Cleaning and
                        disinfecting of Water Tank is very important where number individual works or resides such as apartment complex, restaurant, in medium or large companies. It is duty of water tank owner or property manager to keep
                        water tank clean and prevent contamination of water.

                        <strong>TANK CLEANING &amp; DISINFECTION</strong><br />
                        Scale- deposits of calcium carbonate from the mains created by evaporation at the water line.<br />
                        Algae- contamination by an external source and the exposure of sunlight &ndash; can be caused by an unsecure tank lid or the absence of a lid altogether.<br />
                        Sediment- a low concentration of detritus naturally present in mains water building up over time.<br />
                        Rust &amp; Corrosion- the use of non-stainless steel fittings within a tank, which are exposed to oxidisation leaving a ferrous deposit.<br />
                        Organic matter &amp; Biofilm- pathogens naturally present in the mains water, when provided with the right conditions can proliferate to unacceptable levels.<br />
                        Stagnation- poor tank design resulting in an inadequate turnover and flow of water creating the ideal conditions for bacteria to thrive.<br />
                        Debris &ndash; synthetic materials such as waste created from remedial works<br />
                        Flora Ingress- Inadequate protection from the external of the tank, allowing flora growth to enter the tank.<br />
                        Pest/ insect ingress- inadequate protection/ screening on overflows and air gaps allowing pests and insects to enter the tank.
